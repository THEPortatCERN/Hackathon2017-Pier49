SmartBin User Interface

Installing the UI

0. You must have tomcat8 installed on the pi.  If this is not currently the
   case, use apt-get to install it:

   sudo apt-get install tomcat8

   When you reboot the pi, tomcat8 should start automatically

1. Copy details.sh to the raspberry pi /etc directory. Make it executable

2. Add the line
   
   /etc/details.sh & 

   to the /etc/rc.local script.  This will cause details.sh to run when 
   the pi boots up.

3. Assemble the user interface program using the ant build file by calling:

   ant

   This will create a WAR file in dist:  ui.war

4. Copy the ui.war file to the /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps directory and set 
   its owner id to tomcat8 

5. The user interface is now available on the pi's port 8080.  Using a
   browser on the pi itself, go to:

   http://localhost:8080/ui
